# Testboxed² (tb2)
## What is Testboxed²?
Testboxed² is the successor to the game Testboxed - a sandbox on the Unity engine, for your fun, those who like to break something, and not only.

Developed by DFC - a community and team of independent designers and developers.

## Gameplay
Like the original Testboxed, there are game modes like Roblox.  As a fan of playing without lags (and with good graphics), I tried to optimize it quite well.
